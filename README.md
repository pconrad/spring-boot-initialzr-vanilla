# spring-boot-initialzr-vanilla

A repository that contains what I got with a plain vanilla Spring Boot Initializr setup

I used the following options (basically, all of the defaults), on Monday 09/16/2019.

I then unzipped the resulting demo.zip file into this repository.

Any changes subsequently made are documented in the git history of this repo.
